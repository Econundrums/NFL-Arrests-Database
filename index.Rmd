# NFL Arrests Database

If the only thing you knew about a person is that they're a football player and a violent criminal, what position do you think they play? This was a question a friend of mine posed to me one day, one that I figured had already been researched and that the answer was a quick Google search away. It isn't, but there is a database on [USA TODAY](https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/arrests/) that records NFL player arrests with information such as their name, position, team they played for, type of crime, etc. With this information at hand, could we possibly find an answer?

Our original hypothesis was that players who committed violent crimes were more likely to hold positions that required more physical aggression, which we thought would be the majority of the defensive positions (e.g. Linebackers, Corner Backs, etc.) since their job is to attack the offense.

# Data Collection and Cleaning

The first thing to do is collect and clean the data, which can be accomplished by building a web scraper to go on the USA Today website and scrap the database. 

*A very sincere hat tip to [Andrew Cantino](https://vimeo.com/tectonic) for creating the [Selector Gadget](https://selectorgadget.com/) tool that helped me parse through html code and identify the css input needed to scrap the data columns.

```R
WebScraper = function(url, css){
  webpage = read_html(url)
  htmlColumn = html_nodes(webpage, css)
  column = html_text(htmlColumn)
  return(column)
  }
  
website = 'https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/arrests/'

NAMES = WebScraper(website, '.arrest-name')
POS = WebScraper(website, '.arrest-narrow:nth-child(4)')
TEAM = WebScraper(website, '.arrest-narrow:nth-child(2)')
CASE = WebScraper(website, '.arrest-midsize:nth-child(5)')
CATEGORY = WebScraper(website, '.arrest-midsize:nth-child(6)')
DESCRIPTION = WebScraper(website, '.left:nth-child(7)')
OUTCOME = WebScraper(website, '.outcome')

NFL_dataframe = data.frame("NAMES" = NAMES, "POS" = POS, "TEAM" = TEAM,
                           "CASE" = CASE, "CATEGORY" = CATEGORY, 
                           'DESCRIPTION' = DESCRIPTION, 
                           'OUTCOME' = OUTCOME, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Note that in the "OUTCOME" column of the data frame there are many entries with the sentence "Resolution undetermined." These are players who have yet to be deemed guilty or not guilty. For my purpose, it's best to remove these players from the database since only players with known verdicts are of importance. The following piece of code will accomplish this, as well as define an empty column titled "GUILTY" (which will be elaborated on below).

```R
NFL_dataframe = NFL_dataframe[grepl("Resolution undetermined", 
                                    NFL_dataframe$OUTCOME) == FALSE, ]
NFL_dataframe$GUILTY = NA
```

<a name="NB"></a> 

# Text Mining and Prediction: Naive Bayes Edition

Now all the remaining players within the database need to be classified as either guilty or not guilty -- i.e. a value of 1 in the GUILTY column if guilty and 0 otherwise.

I *could* just go through each row and categorize each row a 1 or a 0 based on the description in the OUTCOME column, but that would take too long. It would be better to write an algorithm that mines the text in the OUTCOME column and then predicts whether or not to classify each player as guilty or not guilty based on what it reads. A homemade Naive Bayes R script will do this.

If you want to learn the theory behind Naive Bayes (NB) combined with Bag-of-Words (BoW) as a method of text classification, there are plenty of references out there, but the ones I thought were most useful were [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKeC2S44Rs) (for learning how to do it by hand), [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/slides/7_Sent.pdf) (as an overview of sentiment analysis), and [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/the-bernoulli-model-1.html) (more into the weeds. About ~90% of how my code is structured is based on the information contained within this link).  

<a name="trainTestNB"></a> 

### Training and Testing the NB Algorithm

First, I will (unfortunately) have to manually label some of the rows with either a 0 or a 1 (which I did in Excel for the first 108) so that the algorithm can train on said rows and use the results to make predictions on the rest of the players in the data set.

Two versions of the NB algorithm will be created; one to test the code on the first 108 rows mentioned to make sure it's running properly and making accurate predictions, and one slightly modified to classify the remaining unclassified rows.

Below is the "testing" version of the code. (It's currently folded up due to its sheer length.)

Now to test the algorithm.

Quick note: One of the parameters required for our function is what percentage of the data frame (in decimal form) should act as the training data. Sixty percent will be chosen for this exercise, which is a "rule-of-thumb" standard.

```R
NFL_Dataframe_Cleaned <- read_excel("NFL Dataframe - Cleaned.xlsx")
df = as.data.frame(NFL_Dataframe_Cleaned[1:108,])                                  
nb = NaiveBayes(df, "OUTCOME", "GUILTY", 0.6)
mean(nb$predict == nb$actual)
[1] 0.9069767
```
90.7%!!! Not perfect, but I'd say that's pretty darn good!

Below is the algorithm modified to make predictions on the rest of the unclassified rows. (It's ~95% the same.)

<details><summary>Bernoulli Naive Bayes - Prediction</summary>

```R
NaiveBayes = function(trainData, testData, textColumn, outcomeColumn){

# Thesis: Are Violent Criminal NFL Players More Likely to Play Defense?

<a name="prelimAnal"></a>

### Preliminary Analysis

With the newly classified database in hand, it's time to do some analysis. Since our focus will be on violent crimes, we'll need to decide first what exactly we mean by that. Broadly speaking, a violent crime occurs when the offender uses or threatens the use of force upon their victim*.  However, one problem with the database is that the information contained in the "CATEGORY" column is either poorly defined and/or redundant. For example, some players like Dan Connor will have their crime categorized as something as ambiguous as "Weapon", which raises questions such as "Was this player arrested for possessing an illegal weapon, or using a weapon during a murder/assault, or both?" This requires a bit of a deep dive into all the 93 different categories and deciding which ones qualify as a violent crime. As for dealing with redundancy, such as categorizing a crime as "Domestic violence, alcohol" or "Domestic violence, gun", crimes will be categorized as either "Aggravated Assault", "Sexual Assault/Rape", "Robbery", or "Murder" based on whether the description of the crime fits the corresponding categories' definition as defined by the FBI's 2017 [Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Database.](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/violent-crime) The following bit of code will add another column that classifies a crime as one of the 4 violent crime categories stated earlier and everything else as "Non-violent".

<sub><sup>\* This does carry some nuances with it. For example, does brandishing a weapon constitute a threat to use force in the same manner that pulling it out and yelling "I'm going to use this on you!" does? Another nuance is that the definition of what qualifies as a certain sort of violent crime may change over time (e.g. "rape" has had multiple definitions according the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program within the past 6 years, which affects how the statistics are reported). To make the analysis as accurate as possible, the most recent definitions of violent crimes were used according to the definitions set by the UCR (see "Murder & Non-negligent Manslaughter", "Legacy Rape", "Revised Rape", "Robbery", and "Aggravated Assault").</sup></sub>

```R
## Defines violent crimes

violentCrimes = c("Domestic violence", "Bomb threat", 
                  "Sexual assault", "Battery",
                  "Assault, gun", "Domestic violence, rape",
                  "Attempted murder", 
                  "Battery, resisting arrrest", "Domestic",
                  "Gun, assault", "Burglary, assault",

                  "DUI, assault", "Manslaughter", 
                  "Alcohol, assault", "Coercion, gun",
                  "Battery, alcohol",
                  "Domestic violence, alcohol", 
                  "Domestic violence, gun", "Theft, gun",
                  "Burglary, battery")

aggAssault = c("Domestic violence", "Bomb threat", 
               "Battery", "Assault, gun", "Attempted murder",
               "Battery, resisting arrrest", "Domestic", 
               "Gun, assault", "Assault", 
               "Child abuse", "Assault, alcohol",

               "Coercion, gun", "Battery, alcohol", 
               "Domestic violence, alcohol", "Domestic violence, gun")

sexAssault = c("Sexual assault", "Domestic violence, rape")

robbery = c("Burglary, assault", "Robbery", 
            "Theft, gun", "Burglary, battery")

murder = c("Manslaughter, child abuse", "Murder", 
           "Murder, gun", "Manslaughter")

df$VIOLENT = ifelse(df$CATEGORY %in% violentCrimes, "Violent", "Non-violent")

df$VIOLENT_NONVIOLENT = ifelse(df$CATEGORY %in% aggAssault, "Aggravated Assault", 
                          ifelse(df$CATEGORY %in% sexAssault, "Sexual Assault/Rape",
                            ifelse(df$CATEGORY %in% robbery, "Robbery", 
                              ifelse(df$CATEGORY %in% murder, "Murder", "Non-violent"))))
```
Now for some basic data visualizations to see if we can spot any trends in the data. (For brevity, I'm omitting the code to create the charts here, but you can find it within the "NFL Arrest Analysis"" R Script uploaded to the repository.)

Non-Violent vs. Violent Crimes - Count    |  Violent Crimes by Category - Percentage
:----------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------:
![bar chart](Images/bar_chart.png)        | ![pie chart](Images/pie_chart.png)

Based on the bar chart on the left, it seems the majority of the arrests (~ 69%) involve non-violent crimes. Amongst arrests for violent crimes, the vast majority involve some form of Aggravated Assault. 

Now lets look for interesting patterns amongst the players arrested for violent crimes grouped by their field position. For this, some basic donut charts will be created -- one for players accused for a crime and one for players found guilty of said crime.

Violent Crimes By Player Position (Accused) - Percentage  |  Violent Crimes By Player Position (Guilty) - Percentage
:--------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------:
![donut chart 1](Images/donut_chart1.png)                 | ![donut chart 2](Images/donut_chart2.png)


Some interesting things from the donut chart...

1. Linebackers, Corner Backs, and Defensive Tacklers are all defensive positions that are in the top 5 for violent crime arrests. However, amongst players found guilty, they all show a decrease in representation! For Linebackers the decrease is 4.5 percentage points, for Corner Backs it's 1.2, and Defensive Tacklers it's 2.75.

2. Wide Receivers and Running Backs are both defensive positions that are also in the top 5 for violent crime arrests, but, unlike the defensive positions listed above, they all show an increase in representation amongst players found guilty! For Wide Receivers the increase is a measly 0.7 percentage points. What's most interesting is the notable increase for Running Backs and Offensive Tacklers, which is 4.4 and 4.13 respectively. 

These results seem contrary to our initial thoughts of players in defensive roles being more likely to commit violent crimes, and at first glance seem to go against our hypothesis. Does it?

<a name="altHyp"></a>

### Alternative Hypothesis

Recall that our original hypothesis that NFL players who are violent criminals were more likely to play in positions involving more physical aggression, which was thought to be mainly defensive positions since they involve "attacking" the offense to prevent them from obtaining points via touchdowns and field goal kicks. However, perhaps only half of that hypothesis is correct, but instead the greater likelihood of NFL positions being held by violent criminals are offensive positions rather than defensive ones. 

The intuition for such is as follows: To win a football game a team needs to score more points over their opponents. In order to do this, their Quarterbacks need to throw successful passes, Wide Receivers need to successfully catch the ball and run past the defense, Kickers need to be able to kick the ball through the field goal without being blocked, etc. If a coach wants to maximize the amount of points scored, they'll need to maximize their odds of having their offense be able to score points. One way to do this is to place their most aggressive players not in a defensive position, but in an offensive position that protects their Quarterbacks, Running Backs, Kickers, etc. from being tackled/blocked. This relationship, if it exists, would most likely be pronounced amongst Offensive Tacklers and to a lesser extent amongst Running Backs, which is what we saw earlier within our donut charts. 

<a name="multinom"></a>

### Multinomial Logistic Regression

One way to test our alternative hypothesis is to run a multinomial logistic regression for the various positions in the POS column on the binary categorical variable VIOLENT with only guilty players. If the new hypothesis carries any weight, there ought to be statistically significant positive correlation between the independent variable VIOLENT and the dependent variable positions OT (Offensive Tackle) and RB (Running Back).

As you can see, the coefficients for VIOLENT on the positions OT and RB are positive, though greater in magnitude for OT. To determine whether VIOLENT is statistically significant for any of the coefficient estimates, a z-test will be required.

```R

z = summary(model)$coefficients/summary(model)$standard.errors
p = (1-pnorm(abs(z), 0, 1)) * 2

It appears that between the two, as well as any of the other positions listed, OT is the only position in which VIOLENT is statistically significant for (OL can be ignored because it represents one datum point.) Thus, we can conclude that our hypothesis carries reasonable weight in regards to Offensive Tacklers.
